        <p>Game AI is static; generative AI is chaotic and cloud-dependent. Neither is persistent or ownable. ForbocAI is the layer that makes game NPCs local, stateful, and portable—Synthetic Souls with a Ghost in the Machine. We are infrastructure at the intersection of gaming, AI, and decentralized ownership.</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Local inference:</strong> Instant response, zero server burn, full privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Logic-backed intelligence:</strong> AI intent validated against game rules. No hallucinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent memory:</strong> Agents that remember and evolve.</li>
            <li><strong>Ownable agents:</strong> Portable souls—own, trade, port across worlds.</li>
